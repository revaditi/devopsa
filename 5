3. Creating an Ansible Inventory

An inventory file lists the hosts you want to manage. For this experiment, you can use the local host.

Create an Inventory File

1. Open your text editor to create a file called `hosts.ini`:
gedit hosts.ini


1. Add the following content to define the local host:
[local]
localhost ansible_connection=local


gedit setup.yml

3. Save and exit the file.


- name: Basic Server Setup
  hosts: local
  become: yes # Use privilege escalation (sudo)
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install curl
      apt:
        name: curl
        state: present






sudo ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini setup.yml
