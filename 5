sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y

sudo apt install ansible -y

ansible --version

3. Creating an Ansible Inventory

  An inventory file lists the hosts you want to manage. For this experiment, you can use the local host.

  Create an Inventory File

  //Open your text editor to create a file called `hosts.ini`:

  gedit hosts.ini


  //Add the following content to define the local host:

  [local]
  localhost ansible_connection=local

  gedit setup.yml

  //Save and exit the file.

4. Writing a Basic Ansible Playbook

You will now create a simple playbook that performs two common tasks:

- Updating the apt cache
- Installing a package (e.g., curl)

5. Create the Playbook File
Open your text editor to create a file called setup.yml:

gedit setup.yml
â€‹
Add the following YAML content:

- name: Basic Server Setup
  hosts: local
  become: yes # Use privilege escalation (sudo)
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install curl
      apt:
        name: curl
        state: present


6. Running the Ansible Playbook

In your terminal, run the following command:

sudo ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini setup.yml
